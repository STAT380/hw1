```{r}
my_vec <- c(
    "+0.07",
    "-0.07",
    "+0.25",
    "-0.84",
    "+0.32",
    "-0.24",
    "-0.97",
    "-0.36",
    "+1.76",
    "-0.36"
)
```

### 1. What data type does the vector contain?
Floats

### 2. Create two new vectors called my_vec_double and my_vec_int which converts my_vec to Double & Integer types, respectively,

```
