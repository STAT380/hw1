## Question 1
::: {.callout-tip}
## 20 points
:::


In this question, we will walk through the process of _forking_ a `git` repository and submitting a _pull request_. 

1. Navigate to the Github repository [here](https://github.com/STAT380/hw1.git) and fork it by clicking on the icon in the top right

![](images/fork.png)

> Provide a sensible name for your forked repository when prompted. 

2. Clone your Github repository on your local machine

```bash
$ git clone <<insert your repository url here>>
$ cd hw-1
```





3. In order to activate the `R` environment for the homework, make sure you have `renv` installed beforehand. To activate the `renv` environment for this assignment, open an instance of the `R` console from within the directory and type
    
    ```R
    renv::activate()
    ```
    Follow the instrutions in order to make sure that `renv` is configured correctly. 
    
```{R}
renv::activate()
```


4. Work on the _reminaing part_ of this assignment as a `.qmd` file.

    - Create a `PDF` and `HTML` file for your output by modifying the YAML frontmatter for the Quarto `.qmd` document

5. When you're done working on your assignment, push the changes to your github repository.

6. Navigate to the original Github repository [here](https://github.com/STAT380/hw1.git) and submit a pull request linking to your repository. 
    
    Remember to **include your name** in the pull request information!

If you're stuck at any step along the way, you can refer to the [official Github docs here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Question 2
::: {.callout-tip}
## 30 points
:::

Consider the following vector

```{R}
my_vec <- c(
    "+0.07",
    "-0.07",
    "+0.25",
    "-0.84",
    "+0.32",
    "-0.24",
    "-0.97",
    "-0.36",
    "+1.76",
    "-0.36"
)

```


For the following questions, provide your answers in a code cell.

1. What data type does the vector contain?

```{R}
typeof(my_vec)
```


1. Create two new vectors called `my_vec_double` and `my_vec_int` which converts `my_vec` to Double & Integer types, respectively, 

```{R}
my_vec_double <- as.double(my_vec)
my_vec_double
```
```{R}
my_vec_int <- as.integer(my_vec)
my_vec_int
```



1. Create a new vector `my_vec_bool` which comprises of:
    * ```r TRUE```if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\le 0$
    * ```r FALSE``` if an element in `my_vec_double` is $\ge 0$
    
```{R}
my_vec_bool <- my_vec_double < 0
my_vec_bool
```


    How many elements of `my_vec_double` are greater than zero?
    
```{R}

sum(my_vec_double > 0)

```



1. Sort the values of `my_vec_double` in ascending order. 


<br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br>

```{R}
my_vec_double_sorted <- sort((my_vec_double))
my_vec_double_sorted
```

## Question 3
::: {.callout-tip}
## 50 points
:::

In this question we will get a better understanding of how `R` handles large data structures in memory. 

1. Provide `R` code to construct the following matrices:
$$
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
7 & 8 & 9\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \text{ and } \quad
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & \dots & 100\\
1 & 4 & 9 & 16 & 25 & \dots & 10000\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

::: {.callout-warning}
## Tip

Recall the discussion in class on how `R` fills in matrices

```{R}
matrix(data = 1:9,

       nrow = 3,

       ncol = 3,

       byrow = TRUE)
```

```{R}
first_raw <- 1:100
second_raw <- first_raw^2
matrix(c(first_raw, second_raw), nrow = 2, ncol = 100, byrow = TRUE)

```


:::

In the next part, we will discover how knowledge of the way in which a matrix is stored in memory can inform better code choices. To this end, the following function takes an input $n$ and creates an $n \times n$ matrix with random entries. 

```{R}
generate_matrix <- function(n){
    return(
        matrix(
            rnorm(n^2),
            nrow=n
        )
    )
}
```

For example:

```{R}
generate_matrix(4)
```


Let `M` be a fixed $50 \times 50$ matrix

```{R}
M <- generate_matrix(50)
mean(M)
```


2. Write a function `row_wise_scan` which scans the entries of `M` one row after another and outputs the number of elements whose value is $\ge 0$. You can use the following **starter code**

```{R}
row_wise_scan <- function(x){
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)

    # Insert your code here
    count <- 0
    for(i in 1:n){
        for(j in 1:m){
            if(x[i,j] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1 
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
```




3. Similarly, write a function `col_wise_scan` which does exactly the same thing but scans the entries of `M` one column after another

```{R}
col_wise_scan <- function(x){
    n <- nrow(x)
    m <- ncol(x)

    # Insert your code here
    count <- 0
    for(j in 1:m){
        for(i in 1:n){
            if(x[i,j] >= 0){
                count <- count + 1 
            }
        }
    }

    return(count)
}
```


You can check if your code is doing what it's supposed to using the function here[^footnote]

4. Between `col_wise_scan` and `row_wise_scan`, which function do you expect to take shorter to run? Why?

# i think it is up to the matrix data. if the matrix nrow greater than ncol then col_wise_scan. if the matrix ncol greater than nrow then row_wise_scan.because it use less time for the first loop.

5. Write a function `time_scan` which takes in a method `f` and a matrix `M` and outputs the amount of time taken to run `f(M)`

```{R}
time_scan <- function(f, M){
    initial_time <- Sys.time()
    f(M)
    final_time <- Sys.time()
    
    total_time_taken <- final_time - initial_time
    return(total_time_taken)
}
```





Provide your output to

```{R}
test <- matrix(data = 1:9,

       nrow = 3,

       ncol = 3,

       byrow = TRUE)
test
```

```{R}
list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, test),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, test)
)

```


Which took longer to run? 

# row_wise_time

6. Repeat this experiment now when:
    * `M` is a $100 \times 100$ matrix
    * `M` is a $1000 \times 1000$ matrix
    * `M` is a $5000 \times 5000$ matrix

What can you conclude?

```{R}
test2 <- matrix(data = 1:10000,

       nrow = 100,

       ncol = 100,

       byrow = TRUE)

list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, test2),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, test2)
)

```

```{R}
test3 <- matrix(data = 1:1000000,

       nrow = 1000,

       ncol = 1000,

       byrow = TRUE)

list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, test3),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, test3)
)
```

```{R}
test4 <- matrix(data = 1:25000000,

       nrow = 5000,

       ncol = 5000,

       byrow = TRUE)

list(
    row_wise_time = time_scan(row_wise_scan, test4),
    col_wise_time = time_scan(col_wise_scan, test4)
)
```
# for small matrix col_wise_time run faster, for big matrix row_wise_time run faster

# Appendix

Print your `R` session information using the following command

```{R}
sessionInfo()
```

[^footnote]: If your code is right, the following code should evaluate to be `TRUE`

```{R}
sapply(1:100, function(i) {
        x <- generate_matrix(100)
        row_wise_scan(x) == col_wise_scan(x)
    }) %>% sum == 100
```
